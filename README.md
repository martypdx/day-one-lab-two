# day-one-lab-two


some **more more** text how nice _is that_?

## Heading Two

- one
- two
- three


### Neapolitan

These three flavors:
1. vanilla 
1. chocolate
1. strawberry

## Note on Terminal

Use the `cd` command to change directory.

If this were JavaScript, we might want to say the `x = 3`;

```sh
> git add -A
> cd dev
```

```js
const x = 3;
console.log(x + 4);
```

```html
<p class="content">This is my paragraph</p>
```
